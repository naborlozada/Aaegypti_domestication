This directory contains three main sections and a single file:

* **`Downsampling_populations_procedure.md:`** Procedure to downsample populations and final SRA IDs.
* **`Genetic_diversity_and_tajimasD_metrics.md:`** Bash script steps used to calculate the genetic diversity and Tajima'sD on each population. An additional R script is provided to reproduced Table 1 and Supplementary Table 5 (Tables 2 and 3) results. 
* **`Population_Branch_Statistics.md:`** Procedure to calculate the PBS on each of the three comparative branches: out-of-Africa against Western Africa with and without Aaa-like mosquitoes (separately), and using samples from Eastern Africa as an outgroup.
* **`aedes_aegypti.downsampled_populations.angsd_pi_tajD_scores_byChrm.parsed.txt:`** File with the original output results from ANGSD for nucleotide diversity (tP) and Tajima'sD.
